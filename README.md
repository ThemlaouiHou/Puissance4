# Connect Four with AI

This project is a **Connect Four game** developed in **C#** with an integrated AI opponent.  
The game implements two decision-making algorithms for the AI: **Minimax** and **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MonteCarloArray)**, allowing different levels of difficulty and strategies.

## Features
- Classic **Connect Four** gameplay.  
- **Player vs Player** and **Player vs AI** modes.  
- Two AI algorithms available:  
  - **Minimax** with configurable depth (deterministic).  
  - **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MonteCarloArray)** for probabilistic decision-making.  
- Clear and simple **graphical interface** in C#.  
- AI provides different play styles for more dynamic games.

##  Algorithms
### Minimax
- Explores possible moves up to a given depth.  
- Uses evaluation functions to maximize player advantage and minimize opponent’s chances.  
- Provides consistent and predictable results.  

### Monte Carlo (MonteCarloArray)
- Simulates many random playouts from each possible move.  
- Chooses the move with the best statistical outcome.  
- Adds unpredictability and flexibility to the AI’s behavior.
